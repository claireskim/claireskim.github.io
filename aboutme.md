My name is Claire. I am:

- Perusing consciousness studies. There are many types of consciousness studies; I'm exploring consciousness as in the nature of consciousness, and asking primordial questions such as, "What is it?" and "Who am I?.
- Creating productivity tools.

What else do you want to know?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just read [this page](https://positivepsychology.com/positive-psychology-an-introduction-summary/) and it will answer **all** your questions.
